# <img width="24px" src="./icons/icon-256x256.png" alt=""> Kyoo

Kyoo is a self-hosted media server focused on video content (Movies, Series & Anime). It is an alternative to Jellyfin or Plex.

It aims to have a low amount of maintenance needed (no folder structure required nor manual metadata edits). Media not being scanned correctly (even with weird names) is considered a bug.

Kyoo does not have a plugin system and aim to have every features built-in (see [#Features](#-features) for the list).

## üöÄ Features

- **Dynamic Transcoding:** Transcode your media to any quality, change on the fly with auto quality, and seek instantly without waiting for the transcoder.

- **Video Preview Thumbnails:** Simply hover the video's progress bar and see a preview of the video.

- **Meilisearch-Powered Search:** Advanced, typo-resilient search system powered by Meilisearch.

- **OIDC Connection:** Connect using any OIDC compliant service (Google, Discord, Authelia, you name it).

- **Watch List Scrubbing Support:** Your watch list is automatically synced to connected services (SIMKL and soon others [#351](https://github.com/zoriya/Kyoo/issues/351), [#352](https://github.com/zoriya/Kyoo/issues/352)). No need to manually mark episodes as watched.

- **Download and Offline Support:** Download videos to watch them without internet access, your progress will automatically be synced next time your devices goes online.

- **Enhanced Subtitle Support:** Subtitles are important, Kyoo supports SSA/ASS and uses the video's embedded fonts when available.

- **Anime Name Parsing**: While there are still some issues (see [#466](https://github.com/zoriya/Kyoo/issues/466), Kyoo will match weird anime names (like `[Some-Stuffs] Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Stone Ocean 24 (1920x1080 Blu-Ray Opus) [2750810F].mkv`) without issue.

- **Helm Chart:** Deploy Kyoo to your Kubernetes cluster today!  There is an official Helm chart.  Multiple replicas is a WIP!

## üì∫ Clients

Kyoo currently supports Web and Android clients, with additional platforms being thought about. Rough estimates:
* Today: Web & Android
* Spring 2025: Chromecast
* Summer 2025: Android-TV

Don't see your client? Kyoo is focused on adding features, but welcomes contributors! The frontend is built with React-Native and Expo. Come hang and develop with us on Discord.

Support for Apple devices (iOS, tvOS) is not currently planned due to buying hardware and yearly developer fee (~$100).

## üìú Why another media-browser?

From a technical standpoint, both Jellyfin and Plex lean on SQLite and confine everything within a single container, Kyoo takes a different route. We're not afraid to bring in additional containers when it makes sense ‚Äì whether for specialized features like Meilisearch powering our search system or for scalability, as seen with our transcoder.

Kyoo embraces the ‚Äúsetup once, forget about it‚Äù philosophy. Unlike Plex and Jellyfin, we don't burden you with manual file renaming or specific folder structures. Kyoo seamlessly works with files straight from your download directory, minimizing the maintenance headache for server admins.

Kyoo narrows its focus to movies, TV shows, and anime streaming. No music, e-books, or games ‚Äì just pure cinematic delight.
